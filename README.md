# Ferox
An old private client, now made public. This will most likely still be maintained in the future, if I ever decide to develop for 1.12.2 again, but most of my efforts are focused towards [Lumen](https://github.com/olliem5/lumen), my new fabric client, for the newest version of the game.

### Info
- The default ClickGUI bind is `p`.
- The default chat prefix is `%`.
- [Baritone API](https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone/releases/download/v1.2.15/baritone-api-forge-1.2.15.jar) is required to run the client.
